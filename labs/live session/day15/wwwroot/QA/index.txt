	<h2 id="what-is">What is Private Aviation?</h2>
	<p id="first-para">When we think about an aeroplane, we normally think about 
	airliners, and imagine hoards of holiday makers jetting off to far-away countries.</p>
	<p class="intro-para">But there are a whole class of aeroplanes that are very, 
	very different. Private aviation is a hobby which thousands of people enjoy 
	- flying small aeroplanes, similar in size to the size of a family car (or smaller!), 
	with a single engine turning a propellor. These hobby pilots either own their 
	aircraft, or rent them from flying clubs. They can be found flying all over 
	the country, any time the weather is good. They enjoy the freedom that being 
	in an aeroplane gives them, the challenge of navigating with nothing more than 
	a map, a compass and a stopwatch, or the thrill of doing aeroabitcs.</p>
	<p class="intro-para">This page will tell you all about this
	<span id="amazing">amazing</span> hobby.</p>

	<h2 id="get-licence">How to get your licence</h2>
	<p>Before you can fly an aeroplane, <span class="very-important">you will need 
	a <em>pilots licence</em></span>. There is a choice of two different types of 
	licence: the <strong>PPL</strong> (Private Pilots Licence) is an internationally-recognised 
	licence that will let you fly an aircraft anywhere in the world; the <strong>
	NPPL</strong> (National Private Pilots Licence) is a slightly shorter course 
	which will give you a qualification that is only recognised in the UK.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The following table summarises the difference between the two licences. A 
	flying school near you will be able to provide more details.</p>

	<h2 id="things-to-do">Things to do with your licence</h2>
	Some people qualify for their pilots licence, then don't know what to do next. 
	Here are some ideas of what you can do:
	<div class="very-interesting">
		<ul class="things-list">
			<li>Visit another airfield for lunch</li>
			<li>Learn some aerobatics</li>
			<li>Learn to fly faster or more complex aircraft</li>
			<li>Fly to France for the weekend</li>
			<li>Take friends and family flying</li>
			<li>Fly with other pilots, flying one way each</li>
			<li>Arrange to meet other pilots at your favourite airfield, then fly 
			there to meet them</li>
		</ul>
